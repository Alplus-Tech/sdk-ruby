module Alplus
  # Background-thread sender with a bounded queue: `#enqueue` never blocks
  # the caller. When the queue is full, the event is dropped (non-
  # authoritative, matching the JS SDK's own batching drop behavior) rather
  # than applying backpressure to the request thread (issue #14 story 7/8).
  #
  # The worker thread is lazily started on first enqueue and is never
  # joined/killed explicitly: Ruby terminates all non-main threads when the
  # process exits, so there is nothing to supervise for a short-lived
  # script or a `Rack::Handler` process to leak.
  #
  # One `Worker` instance is ONE independent delivery lane: its own
  # `SizedQueue` and its own background thread, fixed to one `kind:`
  # (`:error` or `:session`) for its whole lifetime (issue #12 fix). A
  # PRIOR version routed both kinds through a single shared queue/thread —
  # a stalled or slow `/e/errors` POST (up to ~20s across
  # `Retry::MAX_ATTEMPTS` retries) head-of-line-blocked every queued
  # session behind it, and a full queue during an error storm silently
  # dropped the next session, exactly when crash-free data matters most.
  # `Client` now owns two `Worker`s so error backpressure can never delay
  # or drop session delivery, or vice versa.

      # from the queue *before* the worker thread finishes sending it, so
      # `@queue.empty?` alone goes true while a send is still in flight —
      # a concurrent `#flush`/`#close` reading only queue emptiness would
      # return early (TOCTOU). Counting outstanding work instead of

      # succeeding, not after some later point the reader could race.
