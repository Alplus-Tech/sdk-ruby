module Alplus
  # Background-thread sender with a bounded queue: `#enqueue` never blocks
  # the caller. When the queue is full, the event is dropped (non-
  # authoritative, matching the JS SDK's own batching drop behavior) rather
  # than applying backpressure to the request thread (issue #14 story 7/8).
  #
  # The worker thread is lazily started on first enqueue and is never
  # joined/killed explicitly: Ruby terminates all non-main threads when the
  # process exits, so there is nothing to supervise for a short-lived
  # script or a `Rack::Handler` process to leak.

      # from the queue *before* the worker thread finishes sending it, so
      # `@queue.empty?` alone goes true while a send is still in flight —
      # a concurrent `#flush`/`#close` reading only queue emptiness would
      # return early (TOCTOU). Counting outstanding work instead of
      # sampling a flag set after pop closes that window: the increment
      # happens atomically with the enqueue that a caller already observed
      # succeeding, not after some later point the reader could race.
