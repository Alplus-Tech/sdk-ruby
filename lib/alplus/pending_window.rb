module Alplus
  # The post-error log window (issue #47): a built exception item is held
  # here for a short, bounded window before delivery, and log-line
  # breadcrumbs recorded on the SAME thread during the window are appended
  # to it, marked `data: { after_error: true }`.
  #
  # Same-thread attribution is the correctness rule: under a concurrent
  # server, another request's log lines must never pollute this error's
  # timeline. Rails logs the unhandled exception (DebugExceptions) on the
  # request thread AFTER `RackMiddleware` re-raises, which is exactly the
  # window this class keeps open — a request-end seal would run too early
  # to see that line.
  #
  # One lazily-spawned sealer thread sleeps until the earliest deadline and
  # seals due entries; it exits when the list drains and respawns on the
  # next hold. `seal_all!` (called by `Client#flush`/`#close`) seals
  # everything immediately — the window delays delivery, never loses events.
