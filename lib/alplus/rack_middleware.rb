module Alplus
  # Rack middleware: captures any exception that propagates up through the
  # app, then re-raises so the host's own error page / handler still runs
  # unchanged. Installed automatically by the Rails railtie; usable directly
  # in a plain Rack app (`use Alplus::RackMiddleware`).
  #
  # Also resets `Scope` to a fresh, empty one for the duration of the
  # request (issue #17): a thread-pool server (Puma, Passenger) reuses OS
  # threads across requests, so without this a `set_user`/`set_tag` call in
  # request A would otherwise still be visible to request B if it happens
  # to land on the same thread.
  #
  # Session lifecycle (issue #12): opens a fresh request-scoped `Session`
  # (`Session.with_clean_session`, the same reused-thread guard as `Scope`
  # above) and closes it (`Alplus.close_session`) once `@app.call` returns
  # OR raises. Unlike `sdks/elixir/lib/alplus_sdk/plug.ex` (which cannot
  # rescue a downstream plug's exception — see that module's moduledoc),
  # Rack middleware genuinely wraps the rest of the stack in one method
  # call, so `rescue`/`ensure` here is the complete, reliable crash signal:
  # no separate telemetry hook is needed.
