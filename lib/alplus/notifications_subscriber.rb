  # pushes a small, bounded set of framework events into the current
  # request's `Scope` as breadcrumbs, so a captured exception's timeline
  # shows "what happened just before this" without the host app calling
  # `Alplus.add_breadcrumb` by hand (mirrors Sentry's/AppSignal's
  # instrumentation breadcrumbs).
  #
  # Wired from `Railtie#install!` (guarded there too) -- a total no-op
  # outside Rails/`ActiveSupport`, and never subscribed twice even if a
  # host process boots more than one `Rails::Application` (test suites do
  # this routinely).
  #
  # Deliberately a SMALL, fixed event list: more events means more noise
  # per request and a bigger cut of the `Scope`'s bounded breadcrumb ring
  # buffer (`Scope::MAX_BREADCRUMBS`) spent on framework chatter instead of
  # the host app's own `add_breadcrumb` calls.
