module Alplus
  # Request-scoped session-health tracker for AL+ Observe's crash-free
  # sessions metric (issue #12). One request = one session, Sentry
  # "request-mode" style: `Alplus::RackMiddleware` opens it, this class
  # accumulates its outcome as the request runs, and the middleware closes
  # it once `@app.call` returns (or raises).
  #
  # State lives on `Thread.current`, exactly like `Scope` and for the same
  # reason: a thread-pool server (Puma, Passenger) reuses OS threads across
  # requests, so this must be reset per request rather than shared.
  #
  # Three outcomes, in ascending severity, matching
  # ARCHITECTURE.md's decision #2 (Sentry-aligned):
  #
  #   * `:healthy` -- the request completed with no captured error.
  #   * `:errored` -- the request captured a handled error (any
  #     `Alplus.capture_exception`/`capture_message` at level
  #     `"error"`/`"fatal"`).
  #   * `:crashed` -- the request raised an exception that propagated,
  #     unhandled, up through `RackMiddleware`. Only this state counts
  #     against crash-free sessions.
  #
  # Severity only ever increases within one request: `mark_errored` is a
  # no-op once `mark_crashed` has run (`RackMiddleware`'s rescue calls
  # `Alplus.capture_exception` for the crash itself, which would otherwise
  # downgrade the outcome back to `:errored`).
