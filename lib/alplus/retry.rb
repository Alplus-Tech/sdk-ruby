  # Shared retry/backoff loop for both `Transport` (`POST /e/errors`) and
  # `Heartbeat` (`POST /h/:token`) — issue #16 explicitly asks the two share
  # this, unlike the JS SDK's `transport.ts`/`heartbeat.ts`, which duplicate
  # it deliberately because heartbeat there already shipped and touching it
  # was the higher-risk move. Both Ruby callers land in this change
  # together, so that risk does not apply here.

  # Constants (3 attempts, 500ms jittered exponential base, 30s Retry-After
  # cap) mirror `packages/sdk/src/core/observe/transport.ts` byte-for-byte
  # so all SDKs back off the same way against the same ingest endpoint.

    # wall-clock time). A 429's `Retry-After` is capped at
    # `max_retry_after_seconds` (default `MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS`) —
    # `Heartbeat` passes a much lower cap so a caller pinging synchronously
    # can never be made to block anywhere near the server's full 30s cap.
    # Never raises: a block error on the final attempt is captured on the
    # returned `Result`, not re-raised.
